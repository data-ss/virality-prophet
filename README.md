# Virality Prophet 

### Project: DSI 5 Toronto Hackathon - Virality Prophet (YouTube)

Scenario: This is a NLP-based classification project where we trained a [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/) classifier to predict whether a new YouTube video will go viral or not (based on certain accepted inputs).

Following that we Pickled the trained model, designed a simple front-end to interact with it by accepting user inputs via Flask/Jinja, and hosted the entire package on Heroku.
